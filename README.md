# YOLO3---Object-and-Lane-Detection
INFORMATION:
Data: PASCAL VOC(PASCAL Visual Object Classes) Challenge. 
Tools: Pycharm, Tensorflow, Keras, cv2. 
DataAnalysis: The PASCAL VOC dataset is divided into three subsets: 1,464 images for training, 1,449 images for validation, and a private testing set. 
OUTPUT:
Focusing on object and lane dection. The model can detect 80 objects. The green color which is plotted on the road shows the detection part of the lane in the road and bounding boxes are the detected objects from the model.
